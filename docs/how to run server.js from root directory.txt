	Inside Node.js Command Prompt
		Go to your project directory (where you cloned the GitHub project)
		npm install -g bower
		npm install
		bower install
		// These 4 installs fix the errors that appear when running 'node server.js' in Node.js Command Prompt (Windows), in the root-directory meanGetTogether
Change directory to meanGetTogether folder
	cd somepath\meanGetTogether
Verify the server.js file exists in the current directory
	On Windows:
		dir
	On Linux/ Mac OS X:
		ls | grep server.js
Start the Node.js server
	node server.js
Open a Web browser (such as Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome) to the following URL:
	http://localhost:8080
Run MongoDB
	C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.0\bin
	Run mongod.exe
	Run mongo.exe
